My Neovim configuration
===

This is my personalized neovim configuration.

## Colors
- [Gruvbox-Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)

Using the original dark color scheme with a hard contrast.

I've also set the sign and color column to be the background color, to have a
unified layout in my buffers.
