My Neovim configuration
===

This is my personalized neovim configuration.

## Colors
- [Gruvbox-Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)

Using the original dark color scheme with a hard contrast.

I've also set the sign and color column to be the background color, to have a
unified layout in my buffers.

## Mappings
- `<leader>` is the space key
- small plugin to strip trailing whitespace on `<leader>x`
- quicker saving on `<leader>w`
- yanking to the system clipboard using `<C-c>` in normal and visual mode
- quickly move between splits by replacing the `<C-W>` with just `<Ctl>`
